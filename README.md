# Real Estate Web Application
## Project Description
This is a full-stack real estate web application that aims to be used by: Homebuyers, Property renters,  system administrator(s), and (real-state) brokers.
A real estate web application is a digital platform designed to facilitate the buying, selling, and renting, of real estate properties. 
### Homebuyer requirements
1.	Search for a property: The homebuyer can search for properties based on specific criteria such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
2.	Save favorites: Homebuyers can save properties they are interested in, creating a list of favorites for easy access and comparison.
3.	Request a visit to a property: Once interested in a property, the homebuyer can request a viewing appointment through the system.
4.	Search for brokers.
5.	Mortgage Calculator.

### Renters requirements
Similar to homebuyers exceot for mortgage calculators.

### Broker
1.	Submit Offers: Brokers can submit offers for buying properties on behalf of their clients, and track the status of their offers.
2.	Request a visit to a property on behalf of their clients.
3.	CRUD operations on property listings.

## Project Approach
- This project is expected to be completed after 4 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks each.
- There are a total of 6 members and we decided to split up into two smaller groups (frontend and backend).

### Frontend Approach


### Backend Approach
The CRUD operations required by the frontend will be implemented in the backend and the data will be sent through REST API endpoints. 
* The backend team decided to use Java Spring Boot. This is because everyone on the team is familar with Java. Furthermore, Java is object-oriented which allows us to create modular programs and reusabled code. Not only that Java is robust and enforces type safety this will decrease the chances of bugs in our code.
* Spring Boot will be faster and easier to set up compared to Spring. A concern with Spring is that it is very complicated to configure and slow to get started, Spring Boot will help us with these concerns.
* We also decided to go with MongoDB for our database because it is easier to work with compared to MySQL since there is no need to define schemas beforehand. None of the team members have any experience with database schemas.
